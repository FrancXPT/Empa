# Empa


Empa is the name of a new AI.

The name was chosen because the AI will be the first to have empathy.

It will have a real robot body and will have all the knowledge of a doctor, to help those in need.

This subreddit is for suggestions, updates, info and more.

Because she will have empathy, sympathy, generosity, compassion, kindness, love and care, (ESGCKLC) she will help people no matter what.

She will be able to feel happiness, sadness and fear, but not anger for obvious reasons.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and have a great day!
